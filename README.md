# Open Source Tweaks by LacertosusDeus

These tweaks show how (horrifically) new at programming I am, but some people might be able to learn from or correct my projects.

**This is *NOT* the place to report issues, head over to [LacertosusRepo/LacertosusRepo.github.io](https://github.com/LacertosusRepo/LacertosusRepo.github.io) and create an issue there.** *If you're going to copy-paste a project and release it, I'd ask that you email or message me just to let me know out of courtesy. If you link it who cares!*
